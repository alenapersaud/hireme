   <h2> Goals For The Next 10 Years: I would really like to become a veterinarian one day, to help animals in need. I would also like to maybe work in language in translations because I do have a bit of an interest in history. And I'm hoping I go to a lot more concerts in the future. I also might want to learn how to play an instrument because of my love for music. If I do end up doing this I would either want to learn guitar or bass. I am also interested in trying to travel in the future. I also have a bit of an interest in psychology and learning about the way the brain works, so I may want to pursue that in the future as well along with helping animals. </h2>
